Eclipse Plugin Configurations
=============================
This project includes the various plugin configurations I use when developing in Eclipse.  Many people don't know that you can import and export your plugin configuration to save time when setting up a new instance of Eclipse.  To do so, follow these steps from within Eclipse:

1. Click *File*
2. Click *Export*
3. Choose *Install*
4. Select *Installed Software Items to File*
5. Click *Next*, select the plugins you wish to export and *Finish* the wizard.

The import process is simply the reverse of the export process.
